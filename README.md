## 👋 Hi, I’m Abhishek Singh (@abhirsingh16)

I’m a **Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer** with a strong foundation in analytics, machine learning, and large-scale data systems, backed by nearly a decade of experience in IT operations, systems support, and production environments.

My transition into Data Science and AI is driven by hands-on work across **classical ML, deep learning, and GenAI**, with a focus on building **practical, explainable, and production-aware ML systems** rather than chasing benchmark scores.
