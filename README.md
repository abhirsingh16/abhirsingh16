## 👋 Hi, I’m Abhishek Singh (@abhirsingh16)

I’m a **Data Scientist / AI Engineer** with nearly a decade of experience across IT operations, systems engineering, and data-driven problem solving, currently focused on applied **Machine Learning** and **Generative AI**.

My background in large-scale operations and production systems strongly influences how I approach ML — end-to-end, pragmatically, and with attention to real-world constraints. I care less about leaderboard scores and more about **clean workflows, correct evaluation, and explainable decisions**.

### What I work on
- Classical ML: regression, classification, anomaly detection
- Tree-based models: **XGBoost, Random Forest**, feature selection, bias–variance trade-offs
- Model evaluation using **cross-validation**, not just single splits
- API-first ML systems using **FastAPI / Flask**
- GenAI & NLP explorations: **RAG, LLM orchestration, LangChain, LangGraph, MCP** (actively learning & building)

This GitHub contains a mix of **practice notebooks**, **end-to-end ML use cases**, and **GenAI experiments** as I continue to deepen my skills.

- 👀 Interests: Applied ML · AI Systems · GenAI · Practical MLOps
- 🌱 Currently learning: Advanced GenAI patterns, LLM tooling, and scalable deployment
- 🤝 Open to collaboration on meaningful ML / AI projects
